 🚀 ARTISHOW Project - Télécom Paris (1st Year)  

This project was developed as part of the **first-year curriculum at Télécom Paris**, in collaboration with **Luc Kreucher** and **Ruoxuan Yang**.  

 🎯 Project Objective  

The goal of this project is to design a **5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor from scratch**, along with the following components:  

- 🎨 **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**  
- 🖥️ **VGA Controller** for image display  
- 🎲 **LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register)** for random number generation  

Everything is implemented in **SystemVerilog**.  

 🛠️ Contributions  

 🔢 RISC-V Processor  
- Designed and implemented the **core components**:  
  - ⚙️ **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**  
  - 📜 **Instruction Decoder**  
  - 🎯 **Program Counter (PC)**  
- Developed and debugged a **non-pipelined** version of the processor  
- Debugged the **pipelined** version of the processor  

 📝 Compilation & Testing  
- Created a **assembler** (`execute.py`) to transform RISC-V instruction to HEX code  
- Wrote **assembly programs** for testing and debugging the processor, including RAM memory-mapped I/O interactions  

 🎮 Graphics & Game Development  
- Developed an **assembly program** utilizing the GPU  
- Started a **Pac-Man game** (currently displaying a moving red dot 🟥)  

 🛠️ Hardware Support
-🖥️ **FPGA Board**: DE1-SoC-MTL2 (SoC: 5CSEMA5F31C6N)
